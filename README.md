# Expo ImagePicker Promise Resolution Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo ImagePicker library where the promise returned by `launchImageLibraryAsync` or `launchCameraAsync` sometimes fails to resolve correctly, leading to application crashes or unresponsive behavior.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reliably reproduce.

## Bug Description

The promise returned by the ImagePicker's asynchronous functions (`launchImageLibraryAsync` and `launchCameraAsync`) sometimes rejects unexpectedly or hangs indefinitely. This prevents the application from updating its UI with the selected image or from continuing execution.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an iOS or Android emulator/device.
4. Attempt to select an image using the ImagePicker.
5. Observe that the app may or may not crash or become unresponsive.  The inconsistency in the bug is a major obstacle in debugging.

## Solution

A potential solution includes implementing robust error handling to catch rejected promises and adding timeout mechanisms to prevent indefinite hangs.  Additional details are provided in `bugSolution.js`

## Additional Notes

This bug appears to be related to asynchronous operations and may be triggered by the timing of other tasks within the application.  Further investigation may be needed to identify the root cause and develop a more comprehensive fix.

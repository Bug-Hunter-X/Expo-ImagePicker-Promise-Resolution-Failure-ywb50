This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in combination with other asynchronous operations.  The issue is that the ImagePicker's `launchImageLibraryAsync` or `launchCameraAsync` functions sometimes return a promise that resolves with an unexpected value, or that never resolves, leading to a state where the application becomes unresponsive or crashes.  The problem appears to be intermittent, making it hard to reproduce consistently.  The code below demonstrates the issue.  The promise returned by the ImagePicker API unexpectedly rejects or never resolves, leaving the `selectedImage` variable unassigned, causing the app to crash.
